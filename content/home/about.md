Hi! I am an MSc student in Statistical Science at the University of
Oxford. I enjoy applying Machine Learning and statistical modelling
techniques to real-life problems, especially in (social) network and
time-series analysis.

During my free time, I love tinkering with functional programming
languages for scientific simulations and with embedded development and
electronics.
